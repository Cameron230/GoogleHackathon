### Basic project structure
I reckon it should be something like:
* One UI module for foodbanks to selects which items they need
* One UI module for customers to accept an offer to donate that item
* A database for storing/querying whih items are in demand at which foodbanks
* Some kinda ML module??

### Dependencies
Run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install deps.
