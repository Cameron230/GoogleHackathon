### Basic project structure
I reckon it should be something like:
* One UI module for foodbanks to selects which items they need                  (React)
* One UI module for customers to accept an offer to donate that item            (React)
* A database for storing/querying which items are in demand at which foodbanks  (BigQuery?)
* Some kinda ML module                                                          (AutoML?)

### Dependencies
Run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install deps.
